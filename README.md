# MyMusicApp
Music app to store your favourite artists and their songs.

This app is the resulting project that I've created for the [Architect Coders](https://architectcoders.com/) course.

You could find different branches following different presentation patterns as well as some different Jetpack components.

* In master branch you will find the following:
  * SOLID
  * Clean architecture
  * MVVM
  * Jetpack: Room and Data Binging (as well as Navigation in its specific branch)
  * Dependency Injection with Dagger2
  * Testing: Unit, Integration, ViewModels and UI with Espresso
  * Coroutines
  * Multi-language support: English, Spanish & Catalan
  * ...and a lot of Kotlin (I truly do love Kotlin)
